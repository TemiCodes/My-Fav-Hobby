        My fav hobby is to code, I like coding because coding is fun and you can use it for other people like kids or adults you can use it to create anything. Coding comes in diffrent languages like python, js, html and lots of other languages. But I, Temidayo Sodeinde started of with blockly/block coding. Block coding was pretty fun so if your new I suggest using blockly.

        I first started out with using White Hat Jr. which got me into studiocode.org, thunkable, firebase and dialogflow. when school came I had to use scratch and tinker to do my coding and to help me get into scratch I used udemy. I focused a lot on scratch, When summer came I used whjr again was learning about codepen.io and brackets.
